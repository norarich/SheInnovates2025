# Inspiration
Social cataloging applications, specifically GoodReads, LetterBoxd, and Yelp, provide a platform for users to review and catalog specific forms of media, restaurants, locations, etc. However, as a group, we discovered that there is no platform that provides a space for music discourse. With all music apps providing thousands and thousands of songs, there is a disconnect in social media that allows music listeners to discuss, share, and rate their favorite songs.

# What it does
Forte is a social cataloging app much like LetterBoxd but for music! Forte allows users to rate songs, view other's ratings, create a list of favorite songs, share what they listen to in real-time, and much more. Forte is the new hotspot for all music lovers!

# How we built it
Using Javascript, HTML/CSS, JQuery, and Bootstrap libraries, we were able to create our music reviewing application.

# Challenges we ran into
Challenges we ran into while developing Forte mostly involved learning how to use HTML and CSS. Instead of using front-end web development applications, we wanted to challenge ourselves to develop both the front end and back end of our project. This required a large amount of research and running into many errors. Our largest challenge was stepping up our front end by using Bootstrap. In addition to being beginners to HTML, we also decided to take our project to the next step by utilizing Bootstrap's framework.

# Accomplishments that we're proud of
As aforementioned, our group decided to take on the extra challenge of coding our front end and back end. The accomplishment we are most proud of is that our front end and our back end are both fully functioning. The process of teaching ourselves how to develop a website using HTML/CSS, utilizing Javascript, and producing a final project was no easy feat, but we are proud of the result.

# What we learned
Our biggest takeaway from this project is that challenging yourself pays off. As a group, we decided that developing both the front end and back end from scratch was going to be difficult, but worth it. By doing so, we were able to customize our application and produce the project we wanted. In addition to a result we are proud of, we can also confidently say we have learned a new skill.

#What's next for Forte
Increased Song Database: The next update we would like to apply to Forte is to increase the number of songs on our app! By doing so, we will be able to increase the number of users and interactions.
Interactive Songs: Another update we would like to apply to Forte is to create the ability to see reviews, ratings, and discourse for specific songs! This will allow users to streamline their interests and see what they want to see.
